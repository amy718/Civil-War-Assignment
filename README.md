# Civil-War-Assignment
first, I used demscore to create a dataset including the following things: civil society, cso repression, and clientelism.
then, I renamed these variables in the dataset in stata.
next, I performed a summary statistics command using the three mentioned variables.
then, i regressed client index on the civil society and cso repression variables.
I then used a scatterplot to show how clientelism, civil society and and cso repression are related.
I also summarized the clientelism index variable in a scatterplot by year.
After many attempts to merge the datasets to no avial, I separately explored the Votes for Populism Dataset. I removed all unecessary variables and left ones pertaining to country, year, populist president, entered government, name of populist. With this dataset, I used the table command to organize populist presidents by year per country.
